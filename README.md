```

And then:

```sh
brew install sshop
```

### üì¶ Curl + install.sh

Alternativly you can use the provided install script:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skullsneeze/sshop/master/install.sh | bash
```

---

## üí° Usage

Simply run:

```sh
sshop
```

This will prompt you to select a client and then an environment to SSH into.

```
Options:
  --add, -a             Add new client via interactive prompts
  --edit, -e            Edit existing client via fzf + interactive prompts
  --delete, -d          Delete existing client via fzf + interactive prompts
  --config, -c <file>   Use a specific clients.json config file
  --help, -h            Show this help message
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

By default, `sshop` reads the configuration file from:

```
~/.sshop/clients.json
```

You can override this by setting the `JUMP_CONFIG` environment variable or using the `--config` option:

```sh
sshop --config /path/to/your/clients.json
```

### üìã Clients

Clients are managed in a json file using the following structure:

```json
{
  "clients": [
    {
      "name": "Example Client",
      "servers": [
        {
          "name": "Production",
          "host": "prod.example.com",
          "port": 22,
          "username": "ubuntu"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Another Client",
      "servers": [
        {
          "name": "Test",
          "host": "test.sample.com",
          "port": 1234,
          "username": "test_sample"
        },
        {
          "name": "Production",
          "host": "sample.com",
          "port": 2222,
          "username": "root"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
